# • Link: https://hani-alhamad-react-weather-app.netlify.app/

• Used a free weather API in that app (and its the reason why daily tab is limited to 3 days only).   
• The API that i used: https://www.weatherapi.com/   
• Features in this app:
- Dark & Light modes.
- Location.
- Search bar with suggestions (from the API).
- Hourly auto update.
- Remembers your city and other choices (in browser local storage).

• Used Reactjs and CSS to create it.   
• React Hooks that i used: useContext, useState, useEffect, useCallback.   
• Used React Icons as well.
